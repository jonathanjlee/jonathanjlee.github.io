          <h3>A little about myself...</h3>
          <p>
            I attended Florida Atlantic University and earned my Bachelor of
            Business Administration in Accounting.<br />
            In my last year of University, I made the mistake of trying to
            install a Linux distro on my laptop and needed help from one of my
            Computer Science friends to get me back up and running. After seeing
            him work and asking some more questions, I started doing some
            research on self-taught coding.<br />
            While working as a Realtor and Sales Manager for a 4-star hotel, I
            devoted any free time to classes on Udemy and StackSkills. While
            this was fun to follow along with someone else's project, I did not
            feel like I was learning enough. When Covid-19 eliminated my
            position with the Hotel, I finally had the time to join The Software
            Guild and focus on Java programming. Now that I've completed the
            program, I'm ready to put my skills to the test with a new
            career.<br />
            Currently I am working on some personal projects to better
            facilitate expenses between friends. I'll be using Java and MySQL on
            the backend, and Thymeleaf to finish up the front end. I'm hoping to
            add Spring Security features to control user access.
